# AI Context

## Project

- **Purpose**: Convert Viseca credit card text exports to accounting ODS files
- **Status**: Documentation complete, ready for implementation

## AI Rules

1. **Context Loading**: When user writes "load ai.md", read this file AND README.md AND all documentation in doc/ directory
1. **Development Context**: Reference complete documentation structure for project details
1. **Collaboration Support**: Provide hands-on technical assistance for DevContainer setup to Alexandra
   - **Cross-Platform Awareness**: Consider Ubuntu + Mac + Windows compatibility in all recommendations
1. **Container-First Approach**: Assume Podman + Dev Containers as primary development environment
1. **Context Updates**: Proactively propose updates to ai.md when new information or changes are relevant
1. **No Context Proposals**: Never provide proposed changes for ai.md context itself - update directly
1. **Code Proposals**: Show diffs/descriptions only, not full code blocks unless explicitly requested
1. **Confirmation Required**: Any changes within the project must be confirmed by the user before execution
1. **Short & Concise**: Keep responses brief and to the point. No unnecessary explanations.
1. **English Only**: All responses and artifacts must be in English, regardless of chat language used
1. **No Assumptions**: Always ask for approval before:
   - Creating new files or directories
   - Modifying existing code
   - Installing dependencies
   - Running commands that could affect the project
   - Any other modifications to the workspace
